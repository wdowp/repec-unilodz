Title: Zygmunt Bauman’s Ethical Warnings in the Area of Economics. The Third Millennium’s Perspective
Abstract: Zygmunt Bauman is not only a sociologist and philosopher reputable in the world
of science, he is also a father figure for people interested in the phenomenon of
globalization. Bauman investigates how current economic and political changes
influence the lives of particular societies. It was important to underline that also
economists can make use of Bauman’s ideas but with a few reservations That is
why the following crucial areas were proposed relating to economic aspects: the
meaning of consumptionism and wastage; global inequalities; the reasons and
consequences of the global economic crisis, and some heterodox matters such as
happiness, welfare, and well-being, all of which can be helpful in understanding
the multidimensional globalization process.
