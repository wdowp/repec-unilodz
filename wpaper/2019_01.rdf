Title: Structural Factor Analysis of Interest Rate Pass Through in Four Large Euro Area Economies
Abstract: In this paper we examine the influence of monetary policy at the ECB on mortgage and business lending rates offered by banks in the major euro area countries (Germany, France, Italy and Spain). Since there are many different policy measures that have been undertaken, we utilise a dynamic factor model, which allows examination of impulse responses to policy shocks conditioned by structurally identified latent factors. The distinct feature of this paper is that it explores the effects of three channels of policy transmission - short-term rates, long-term rates and perceived risk - ultimately directed towards bank lending rates. The analysis of the pass through is carried out in pre-crisis and post-crisis sub-samples after the financial crisis to demonstrate the changing influence of different policy measures on lending rates.
