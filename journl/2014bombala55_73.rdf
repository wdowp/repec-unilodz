Title: Od Harmela do Ouimeta – przedsiebiorczosc etyczna w praktyce/From Harmel to Ouimet – Ethical Entrepreneurship in Practice
Abstract: The article presents an analysis with the method of phenomenological praxeology
of two concepts of entrepreneurship: the nineteenth-century concept of Leon Harmel
and that of J.-Robert Ouimet. The ontological-ontic coherence functions as
the main practical directive of phenomenological praxeology, according to which
it is necessary to preserve the ontological-ontic coherence of management in order
to ensure the high efficiency of an enterprise and high level of ethics in its command
structures. The analysis leads to the conclusion that Harmel’s and Ouimet’s
concepts, based on promoting dignity and servant leadership, ensure the ontological-
-ontic coherence of management and can be seen as a model (as a paradigm) of ethical
entrepreneurship.
