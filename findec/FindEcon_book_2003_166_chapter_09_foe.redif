Title: The Nominal Convergence Criteria Financial Market Development and the Real Convergence
Abstract: The article attempts to review the issue of the current Eastern enlargement of the European Union (EU) by the new candidate countries. The accepted obligations of the membership have a permanent impact on the economic policy of the accession countries. The nominal convergence objective of the economic authorities leads to the convergence in the inflation rates, and the prices of financial assets across the EU. Besides the subsequent liberalisation of the capital flows and the institutional adaptation, it is the perspective of Maastrich criteria fulfilment that directly forms the financial market conjuncture, and indirectly, the whole economic condition. We tried to assess the compatibility of the Maastricht criteria and their conformity with the economic policy of the candidate countries and with the main goal of the European integration i.e. real convergence, that relies on the reduction of civilisation development of the Central Eastern European countries with the Euroland.
