Title: DEA Analysis of the Polish Stock Market
Abstract: The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for the portfolio valuation is a brand new application of the method, which was so far widely used in the assessment of decisions made by microeconomic units. We present the empirical models of a relative efficiency for the Polish stock market from the input-output perspective. The valuation of the portfolio selection is based on the available market information selected in the set of the connected fundamentals. The DEA-effective and DBA-ineffective stocks are introduced, and the potential adjustment path to equilibrium is explained. We find the method helpful in a medium-term investment decisions on the capital market, ready to use for investors. We claim that the economically reasonable DEA model could become a good alternative for a traditional fundamental analysis of the stock market.
