Abstract: The subject matter of the paper is the John Paul II teachings on the fields of a state’s
activity in economic life. The first part of article talks about general elements of
economic order: private property, liberal market, a just salary for labour and the
participation of workers in the control of a business. The second part of the paper
confirms that the state ought to create a solid infrastructure of economy and to find
a good balance between different sectors of economic life. The last part of the paper
