Title: Etyczne aspekty dzialania agentow zawodnikow w pilce noznej/Ethical Problems of Activity of Players’ Agents in Football
Abstract: The players’ agent is a middleman who, on the strength of an agent contract and with pay, becomes obliged to act as a go-between
in concluding contracts between players and clubs or transfer contracts between clubs. According to data of the International Federation
of Association Football (FIFA), at the end of March 2011 there were 5794 licensed agents of football players in 219 national federations.
According to the FIFA’s regulations, players, as well as clubs, have right to engage licensed agents in connection with negotiationg or renegotiationg
of a player’s employment contract or a player’s transfer. Players and clubs are forbidden using services of unlicensed agents.
The FIFA’s Regulations on Players’ Agents – and analogous regulations of the Polish Union of Football – burden the agent with many
obligations. Moreover, definite obligations are imposed on clubs and players. Additional regulations introduce a code of players’ agents
professional conduct. The player’s agent – as well as the player, the club and the union – can be imposed with sanctions for breaking
the abovementioned rules.
In milieus connected with Polish football there is a quite common opinion that, in spite of severe sanctions provided by regulations,
obligations and rules of professional conduct are often broken in activities of players’ agents. However it is an opinion based on rumours
and suppositions, which is not confirmed by decisions of the Department of Discipline of the Polish Union of Football concerning infliction
of punishment.
