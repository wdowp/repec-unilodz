Title: Leadership in Catholic Social Teaching
Abstract: The material subject of Catholic social science is man and his actions taken in the
fields of politics, the economy and society. According to its rules each person should
be engaged in building the world through the realization of his or her vocation. One
kind of vocation might be leading people by acting in accordance with the Gospel
and teachings of the Church. The most important values for the leader in this case
would be: respect for human dignity and human rights, freedom, justice, the subsidiarity
principle and cooperation due to creating the common good. The listed rules
are realized by servant leadership, the idea functioning in the field of management
that derives its origins from Christ’s speech: whosoever will be chief among you,
let him be your servant (Mt 20:27).
