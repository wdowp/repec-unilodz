Title: Etyczne uregulowania kontaktow studentow medycyny z firmami farmaceutycznymi w Stanach Zjednoczonych/Ethical Regulation of Medical Students’ Interactions with the Pharmaceutical Industry in the United States
Abstract: The involvement of the pharmaceutical industry in medical education can be seen
as something completely natural. Who better than the producer of the medicine
would know how the drug was developed, how the process of it being authorized
for sale proceeded, and what the side effects of it are? Today in the United States,
more and more colleges are implementing strong pharmaceutical conflict-ofinterest
policies. Interaction between students and medical school staff with these
companies is undesirable, because they share marketing materials more often than
honest data, and their representatives use various ways to influence these current
and future physicians during their meetings.
This article will describe research which shows what pharmaceutical marketing
directed at students looks like in the USA – its character, frequency, and potential
impact on future medical decisions. Also, ways of regulating interaction
between medical schools, their staff and students and the pharmaceutical industry
will be expressed. Guidelines of the Association of American Medical Colleges,
the Institute of Medicine and the American Medical Student Association will be
described. At the end, questions about their influence on reality and whether medical
schools’ policies can be an effective barrier for pharmaceutical marketing on
medical schools will be asked.
