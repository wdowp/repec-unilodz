Title: Etyczne determinanty zarzadzania osrodkami szkolenia kierowcow w swietle zmian prawnych obowiazujacych od 2013 r./Ethical Management Determinants of Driver Training Centres
in the Light of the Legal Changes Applicable from 2013
Abstract: From 19th January 2013 there have been changes in the operation of driver training
centres due to the legislation regarding vehicle drivers coming into force. Changes
related to the conduct of driving schools concern four major areas. The first one is
a new form of enrolment on driving courses by candidates for drivers, which is done
by using the so-called Profile of Candidate for Driver (PCD) generated by the
county authorities. The second aspect is the new formula of the theoretical state
examination. The third issue is the introduction of cash registers for the operators
conducting drivers’ education. The fourth feature is the introduction of new categories
of the driving license, in particular a category including two-wheeled vehicles.
The existing regulations, as well as the huge competition in the market, have
contributed to the fact that the activity of training of candidates for drivers has been
dominated by the principle according to which the service must be performed in
a cheap and fast way. It automatically translates into the low quality of training and
the disregard of procedural steps associated with it. In practice, the lack of adequate
control on the part of the state is the reason for the fact that driving has become an
arbitrary function based on ruthless marketing and low-cost services. In this situation,
ethical dilemmas arise that, in the author’s opinion, will not necessarily be
resolved by the new legal standards for drivers.
