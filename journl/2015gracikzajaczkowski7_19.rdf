Title: Etyczne aspekty swiatowego systemu handlowego na przykladzie koncepcji Fair Trade/Ethical Aspects of the World Trading System Based on the Example of the Fair Trade Concept
Abstract: The effect of globalization is not only an improvement of living conditions in
many developing countries, but also a widening of development disparities and
economic inequalities between countries of the rich North and the poor South. Fair
trade can be considered as a response to emerging problems of development.
Therefore it is a form of assistance directed to the marginalized producers in the
Global South by enabling them to manufacture, sell and distribute goods to markets
in developed countries. This is an alternative to the existing formula of international
trade, whose aim is to help producers in the South by integrating them
into the current trading system under certain conditions. The idea is to create
a new business relationship between producer and consumer, where the production
and consumption are bound together in a new supply chain and where the
economic benefits are distributed more fairly. It means that the prices of fair trade
products are set at a level that would ensure a steady income to the producer and
would lead to raising their living standards and prosperity. The ethical aspects of
the fair trade system are clear, the problem is whether the fair trade standards can
be used on a wider scale in the global economy, where there is a clash of certain
ethical values with market economy rules based on maximizing profits and increasing
efficiency.
