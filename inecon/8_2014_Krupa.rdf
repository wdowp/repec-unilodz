Title: Model matematyczny relacji wzrostu gospodarczego USA w stosunku do prowadzonych przez ten kraj wojen / A mathematical model of relationship between the economic growth of the USA and wars conducted by that country 
Abstract: The aim of the article is to build a model describing the relationship between the economic growth and military activity of the USA. The model is a proposition of a formal, abstract and deductive approach towards the abovementioned relationship between war and economic growth, based on the example of the USA. The research is based on the results of previous empirical investigations. The inconclusiveness of empirical research suggests a need for an interpretation in a wider context of social reality.
