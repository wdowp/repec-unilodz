Title: Polityka – etyka – Kosciol. Wzajemnosc relacji w swietle tekstow Josepha Ratzingera – Benedykta XVI/Politics – Ethics – the Church. Mutuality of Relations in the Light of the Writings of Joseph Ratzinger – Benedict XVI
Abstract: This article consisting of four points, shows the subject of multiple relationships between the realities of politics, ethics and the
Catholic Church. The issue was presented on the basis of the writings and speeches of Joseph Ratzinger, the current Pope Benedict XVI.
Article begins with a presentation of the relationship between politics and ethics as seen in historical perspective. The second section presents
the so-called „political ethics” of the first Christian communities in the light of the indications contained in some of the New Testament
writings (cf. 1 Thess; 1 Peter) being the basis for the Christian way of acting in the area of policy. The third section indicates some realities
 like: progress, science and freedom – considered sometimes as an unquestioned idols and that`s why named once by Ratzinger „myth of
modernity” – as a threat to connectivity between politics and ethics. The fourth section discusses the teaching of the Catholic Church on
politics and the need for its ethical practice. In addition it contains some concrete proposals of Ratzinger that can be used in contemporary
debates on the fundamental values of a democratic state in contemporary pluralistic societies. It also refers to Pope Benedict XVI appeals for
more ethics of politics.
