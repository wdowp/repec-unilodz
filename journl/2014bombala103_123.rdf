Title: Przedsiebiorczosc personalistyczna - aspekt dydaktyczny/Personalistic Entrepreneurship - Didacitic Aspectsnomics
Abstract: This article presents a reflection on the education of business leaders. The analysis
was based on the phenomenological tradition. The phenomenological approach to
teaching is a help in revealing the horizons of individuals – persons, not filling them
up, e.g. empowering them. These teaching aids should include certain patterns – for
the development of a person, not degradation. Unfortunately, training of business
leaders is still based on instrumental rationality: academic teaching is more focused
on the transfer of knowledge and less on developing the creativity of students. The
phenomenological approach postulates that teaching should be more focused on fostering
creativity. Two stages are important in the teaching process: cognitive and
creative. The first step is to explore pre-existing knowledge, the second triggers the
creative potential of the student. The ‘3i’ formula is a method which allows for the
combination of both steps and the formation of a creative reality.
