Title: Degrowth in the Context of Sustainability Transitions: In Search for a Common Ground
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study how sustainability transitions analytical framework can help to
make other concepts of sustainable socio-economic development more specific and operational.
Specifically, we investigate the linkages between sustainability transitions and degrowth. Both
approaches to transitions – degrowth and sustainability transitions – are closely related.
Ideologically, degrowth represents one of the most far-reaching forms of sustainability transitions,
yet it would benefit from a more stringent conceptualization using the analytical framework of
sustainability transitions. Based on a literature review of both degrowth and sustainability
transitions, we distinguish several aspects which provide a common ground for both approaches.
We apply some conceptual notions from sustainability transitions theory to describe the idea of a
degrowth transition. Then, we analyse case studies of degrowth practices (mainly in an urban
context), which demonstrate that they may be understood and managed as transition experiments.
