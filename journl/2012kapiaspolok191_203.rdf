Title: Edukacja etyczna jako fundamentalny element wychowania w srodowisku akademickim/From Responsibility for Themselves to the Mutual Responsibility
Abstract: Global changes in the world enforce to undertake various transformations also in the area of higher education. The aim of academic
education is not more preparing to work in particular occupation, but rather to form appropriate abilities which are useful at the labour
market. This kind of education must embody overall, multi-aspect character, because it prepares to lifelong learning. Therefore creating
“learning society” one should make an effort into axiological dimension of scientific-technical advance. One ought to take heed of human
elements of education and first of all of ethical issues. Practise shows that human relations bereft of transcend and ethic dimension,
but concentrating only on financial economical goods, on profit, market and competition, don’t bring anyone happiness. Hence there
is an enormous demand in the academic community an ethical reflection. Thanks to it human being is not only improved in anthropological
dimension, but also in social-economical aspect.
