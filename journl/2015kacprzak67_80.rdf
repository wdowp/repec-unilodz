Title: Co teologia ma do powiedzenia ekonomii? Kilka uwag teologiczno-moralnych na temat zycia gospodarczego/What Does Theology Have to Say to the Economy? Some Moral-Theological Remarks on Economic Activity
Approach to the Issue of Social Elites
Abstract: Is theology able to communicate anything to the economy at all? Would not it be
an invasion to an autonomous field of knowledge capable to organize economic
activity of man according to its internal rules? However, when asking the economic
question of how to satisfy material needs, one cannot ultimately avoid another
question – an ethical one – of what the purpose of satisfying those needs is. What
is man really looking for? Theology, on the plane of faith and reason, tries to find
answers to these fundamental, ultimate questions asked by human beings, who are
nowadays often tired of searching for happiness in satisfying the short-term and
often artificially created new and new needs. A theologian in his research listens
first of all to the word that God pronounces to man. This word, contained in the
Bible, sets out the basic lines of the dignity of man, his tasks and the ultimate goal
of his existence, which is to achieve full humanity and maturity, namely happiness
in God. Only in such a perspective, which goes beyond the mundane, one can
properly evaluate every action of man, giving it a rightful place in the whole of his
existence. Specific issues relating to man’s economic activity, as described in the
Bible, invariably refer to this overall dimension of his existence and his ultimate
fulfilment in God as the guarantor of order and the source of life. Hence, any human
activity which ignores the structure of that order, planned by the Creator,
appears to be disordered and, consequently, leads to the destruction of man himself.
