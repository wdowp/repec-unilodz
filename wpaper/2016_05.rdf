Title: Sources of Regional Inflation in Poland

Abstract: This paper aims at shedding some light on the sources of regional inflation in Poland. More
specifically, it investigates the role of external, national and idiosyncratic shocks. In a two-step
procedure, we estimate orthogonal components corresponding to each of these shocks, while
performing variance decomposition to assess their relative importance in explaining inflation in
individual regions. In the course of the paper we develop two ad hoc hypotheses. First, that regional
inflation rates are largely driven by national shocks, while the impact of external shocks is smaller.
Second, that shocks to inflation which are asymmetric between Poland and its external environment
contribute to the cross-regional divergence of inflation rates in Poland. Empirical evidence supports
both of these assertions. Indeed, we show that the importance of idiosyncratic shocks in the Polish
regions is strikingly low. However, regional differences in inflation co-movements can be attributed to
the diverse importance of global and national shocks. In auxiliary regressions we confirm that shocks
which strongly and asymmetrically affect inflation in Poland and the EU, also contribute to crossregional
inflation divergence in Poland. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to
investigate sources of regional inflation in a CEE country.
