Title: The Cost-of-Carry Model for the FW20 Futures Contracts: Threshold Cointegration Framework
Abstract: Chapter 11 presents the cost-of-carry model for futures contracts on the Warsaw Stock Exchange index WIG20. Intraday one-minute data has been used. It has been found that the presence of transaction costs causes mispricing series from non-arbitrage cost-of-carry relationships to have a nonlinear form. Arbitrageurs take a long or a short position only if the mispricing is greater in magnitude than a certain threshold. This causes the dynamics of the mispricing series to be effectively described by threshold autoregressive processes with three regimes. Such processes allow for a unit-root behavior in a middle regime, while at the same time being globally second-order stationary. In the chapter a non-arbitrage relationship is examined in the threshold cointegration framework.
