Title: The Distributions of the Rates of Return on Fixed Target Semi-Variance Portfolios
Abstract: The distributions of the rates of return on the fixed target portfolios and classic Markowitzâ€™s ones are compared on example of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The data used in the analysis refer to the period from 1.01.19% to 28.02.2001. The basic parameters of returns distribution are calculated. The returns on portfolios are non-normally distributed. The analysis of empirical results suggests that, for the Warsaw Stock Exchange, fixed target semi-variance is a more appropriate risk measure than variance.
