Title:  Plea for a Modular Design of Business Ethics –
Basics of The Ethical Substantiation of Economic
Decisions
Abstract:  We regard this article as a plea for the modular design of a practice-related discipline of business
ethics, in which we analyse under what conditions economic decisions and actions in firms – regardless
of their content – are to be understood as morally right. Following the clarification of certain
fundamentals of the ethical substantiation of economic decisions, we describe a system of modules
as the epistemological frame of reference that designs the formal analysis. We examine in detail the contribution of the descriptive module (as a conception of representation), the theoretical module
(as a conception of explanation and prediction), the pragmatic module (as a conception of designing)
and the normative module (as a conception of value-judgment) to the ethical substantiation
of economic decisions and actions.
As a conclusion of the formal analysis, we show that the ideal of the virtuous merchant as a basis
of the ethics of conviction for the substantiation of economic decisions offers, at best, an imperfect
solution. Following this, we give reasons why a practice-related discipline of business ethics as ethics
of responsibility for the substantiation of economic decisions is particularly efficient. The main reason
for this lies in the fact that this discipline integrates relevant insights (statements) from the descriptive,
theoretical, pragmatic and normative modules into a self-contained system of statements. We ensure
the systematic complementation of business administration by the discipline of business ethics
by relating the statements of both systems to the same decisions concerning scarce goods that form
the subject of business administration, and close factual and methodical relations between
the two systems.
