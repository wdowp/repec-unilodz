Title: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Stochastic Unit Root Models with GARCH Disturbances
Abstract: Chapter 11 is devoted to stochastic unit root models with GARCH disturbances applied to the main exchange rates of the Polish zloty. This chapter is theoretically oriented and presents an estimation technique within the Kalman filter framework, which allows for GARCH errors in a stochastic unit root model. It finds evidence for stochastic unit roots in the time series tested.
