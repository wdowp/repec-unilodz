Title: Etyka zawodu inzyniera w swietle wybranych kodeksow/Professional Engineering Ethics in Relation to Selected Codes
Abstract: The paper attempts to analyse the ethical duties of engineers contained in selected engineering 
codes of ethics and indicates a few problems arising in teaching professional engineering ethics 
in technical studies. 
The codes of ethics under analysis, both Polish and foreign (American), show similarities 
and differences. The author indicates the likely causes of these similarities and differences and suggests 
the need for further research on the development of ethical standards as well as their implementation, 
application and enforcement. 
The author discusses teaching ethics based on his own experience and compares a few American 
textbooks used for engineering ethics teaching. The author indicates a lack of necessary teaching 
materials in Polish and the existence of no Polish forum for discussing ethical problems of engineering 
in Poland both in the areas of teaching and research.
