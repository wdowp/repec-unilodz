Title: Aksjomaty, prawo naturalne, wartosci i paradygmaty we wspolczesnych koncepcjach rozwoju/Axioms, Natural Law, Values and Paradigms in Contemporary Concepts of Development
Abstract: Contemporary concepts of development (the process of globalization, sustainable
development) can be diversified according to their relation to axioms, natural law,
values and paradigms. The subcategories obtained constitute the ground for business
ethics. Ethics in business is always needed, however, it can be implemented
at-source (as a component of management) or as an end-of-pipe measure. In Poland,
constitutional regulations guarantee, indirectly at least, business ethics as a component
of management.
