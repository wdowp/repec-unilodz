Title: Spoleczna odpowiedzialnosc w relacjach miedzysektorowych/ Social Responsibility in Cross-Sector Relationships
Abstract: The performance and development of an organisation depends not only on the organisation
itself, but – to an increasing extent – on its relationships with its surroundings.
This also refers to cross-sector relationships outside the world of business. Thus, the
purpose of the article is to analyse the cross-sector collaboration between public administration
and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and to highlight its fundamental
terms and conditions, e.g. trust and social responsibility. The more honesty
there is in such relations, the more trust and willingness to co-operate there arises
in both parties. The analysed model of collaboration between public administration
and NGOs seems to be a helpful tool for the development of collaboration based on
social responsibility
