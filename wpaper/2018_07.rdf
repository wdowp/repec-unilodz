Title: Measuring the Natural Rates of Interest in Germany and Italy
Abstract: In this paper a semi-structural econometric model is implemented in order to 
estimate the natural rates of interest in two large economies of the Euro Area: Germany an Italy.
The estimates suggest that after the financial crisis of 2007-2008 a decrease of the growth rate 
of potential output and the corresponding natural rate of interest was greater in Italy than in 
Germany which could have had important implications for the effectiveness of a common monetary 
policy. Unlike in other studies, it is found that the monetary policy stance was less expansionary 
in Italy as compared to Germany for the whole after-crisis period.
