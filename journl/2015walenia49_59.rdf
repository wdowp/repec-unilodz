Title: Aspekty etyczne systemow oceniania pracownikow w instytucjach publicznych/ Ethical Aspects of the Appraisal Systems in Public Institutions
Abstract: A performance appraisal system forms an integral part of any developed management
concept. The efficiency of such an appraisal system is fostered in institutions
which prioritise quality and continuous improvement, and where innovationfriendly
actions are joined by those that build confidence. An efficient appraisal
system is characterised as follows: it is systemic in character, regular, universal,
flexible, concrete, transparent and simple in application. When implementing
a modern appraisal system, care should be taken to adhere to ethically sound principles
such as fairness, objectivity, goodness and truthfulness.
