Title: Rola etosu w ksztaltowaniu dzialan spolecznie odpowiedzialnych w swietle przeprowadzonych badan/ The Role of Ethos in Shaping Socially Responsible Actions
in the Perspective of Conducted Studies
Abstract: The subject of responsibility has lately become very important in the context of
the economic crisis. In economy, it took the form of social responsibility. It concerns
activities additionally undertaken by organizations in order to establish correct
relations with their employees and society, as well as with regard to the natural
environment.
Therefore, a very important role is played by the ethos of the undertaken socially
responsible actions. To a large extent it is reflected in the ethical dimension.
Thus, in enterprises, codes of ethics have become a base of axiology in building of
the organization cultures. Unfortunately, Polish companies – as shown in the paper
– still attach a minor role to the ethical dimension of business.
