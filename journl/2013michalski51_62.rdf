Title:  Na dobre czy na zle? Wspolny kryzys a dobro wspolne/For Better or Worse? The Common Crisis and Common Good
Abstract:  Crisis, sometimes associated with historically distant times or centrally planned economies,
has turned out to be one of the main contemporary issues. Hence different systems like socialism
and capitalism become similar in their inability to reply to expectations for a safe, peaceful
and abundant life. It means that economic problems are more complex in their nature.
Thorough analysis of the roots of different crises should therefore reach deeper than just
economic explanations. This is the point where ethical and cultural explanations may be useful because
they strive to explore the socio-cultural fabric at its foundations in the hierarchy of values and vision
of human beings and society.
When it comes to contemporary crisis the problem is twofold: firstly, there is the threat
that the crisis will be treated inadequately and not realistically in consequence. Secondly, the roots
of the crisis may not be diagnosed properly, which may lead to false ‘treatment’.
This article is an attempt to highlight the above issues and analyse them in the context
of the common good approach, which seems to offer valuable potential to understand the difficulties
properly and offer a reasonable plan for recovery.
