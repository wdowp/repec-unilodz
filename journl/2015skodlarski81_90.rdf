Title: Stanislaw Staszic. Miedzy Bogiem a natura/Stanislaw Staszic. Between God and Nature
Approach to the Issue of Social Elites
Abstract: From a very young age till the last days of his life, Stanislaw Staszic was occupied
by the question of the relationship between God and Nature. In particular, the
Polish thinker was interested in the vision of the world in which human life and
Nature were seen in unison, in accordance with laws of reason and the outcomes
of scientific investigations. His deliberations on Nature validated his monistic
worldview, encompassed within a deistic general framework. Staszic pointed out
many times that natural order is the creation of God, however, earthly issues are in
the hands of humans. In the last years of his life he withdrew from God. He did
not accept the Church’s hierarchy, while his approach to the Creator was ambivalent.
