Title: The Portfolio of Risky Investments Based on the AHP
Abstract: Chapter 8 presents the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). It finds the AHP a useful tool in multi-criteria decision making, though subjective to a certain extent. This is an alternative to classical mean-variance portfolios where the risk and return must be clearly specified.
