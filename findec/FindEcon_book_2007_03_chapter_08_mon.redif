Title: Bayesian Comparison of GARCH Processes with Asymmetric and Heavy Tailed Conditional Distributions
Abstract: The main goal of this chapter is to define a set of competing GARCH specifications, all with asymmetric conditional distributions, which also allow for heavy tails. As an initial specification we consider GARCH model with conditional Student-t distribution with unknown degrees of freedom parameter, proposed by Bollerslev (1987). By introducing skewness, according to the methods mentioned above and by incorporating the resulting family as a conditional distribution, we generate GARCH models which compete in explaining possible asymmetry of the conditional and unconditional distribution of the financial data. We also consider GARCH process with conditional alfa-Stable distribution, which formally, from the definition, also allows for skewness, see Nolan (1996).
