Title: Miedzynarodowe planowanie podatkowe z wykorzystaniem spólki prawa luksemburskiego 
Abstract: Poland’s tax system has a large number of tax burdens and a complicated structure of individual taxes. This directly affects the decisions made by business entities, which take different attitudes in response to high taxation of their income. One of the reactions of enterprises to taxation may be the use of tax planning. The aim of the article is to present one of the ways of legal international tax planning, which enables minimizing the taxation of entrepreneurs’ income through the use of appropriate structures of legal regulations and legal forms of conducted business activity. The article also draws attention to the process of adapting the created constructions to the changing tax regulations.
