Title: Ethical Development of Professional Image in Professional
Codes of Engineering Ethics
Abstract: The article discusses problems of image development in selected professional
engineering communities, as expressed in their ethical codes. Specific codified
norms are presented and their likely effects discussed on two levels: personal and
social.
The findings show, that not all of the codes of ethics solve the development
problem identically, with the differences likely to cause some variability in behavioural
patterns among members of the professional societies.
The analysis suggests the need for further research and analyses as well as the
standardization of codified solutions to this problem among professional engineering
societies.
