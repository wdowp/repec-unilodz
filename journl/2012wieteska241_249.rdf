Title: Nieetyczne zachowania ubezpieczonych na polskim rynku ubezpieczen/Unethical Behaviour of the Insured in the Polish Insurance Market, the Causes and Consequences
Abstract: For many years we have observed the occurrence of extorting compensation from insurance companies. The scale of it is not fully
identified. Despite the enormous effort to combat with this phenomenon, the size of it is still growing. The article discusses the reasons
for this phenomenon, especially motivation and tendency of the insured to fraud. It also presents the economic consequences of the
phenomenon for insurance companies.
