Title: Monetary policy stress in EMU during the moderation and the global crisis
Abstract: This paper re-examines the problem of monetary policy stress in the EMU, both prior to
the crisis as well as after its outbreak. It aims to (firstly) reconfirm that monetary policy
during the great moderation (i.e. until late 2008) was responsible for fuelling the process
of imbalance accumulation in the EMU, and (secondly) to determine to what extent the
stress was caused by macroeconomic divergences.
We employ a forward-looking Taylor-type monetary policy reaction function with realtime
forecasted data to mimic the ECB monetary policy during the great moderation. The
estimated coefficients are subsequently used to create counterfactual series of ruleconsistent
country-specific interest rates and compute monetary policy stress in EMU
individual member states.
The results confirm that peripheral countries were exposed to risks emerging from
excessively low interest rates, while the “core” countries had to live with too-high interest
rates, and the stress was generally stronger in the former case. Interestingly, the bulk of it
was non-fundamental, i.e. not caused by inflation and output gap differentials between
countries. There are several potential sources of this stress and we show that missed
forecasts were making an important contribution and they were mainly responsible for
pushing the interest rate below its rule-consistent level.
