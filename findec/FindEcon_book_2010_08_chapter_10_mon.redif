Title: Pricing the WIG20 Index Options Using GARCH Models
Abstract: In Chapter 10, Fiszeder focused on the pricing of the WIG20 index options using GARCH models. It was concluded that option valuations based on GARCH models are more accurate than those based on the traditional B-S model. The application of the GARCH model could explain most pricing biases of the B-S model in the testing period.
