and learning of Christ, community of the Church. The second part of paper discusses elements ontologicalanthropological
and biblical-ethical which are necessary in the realisation of solidarity’s principle. They are
following: pluralism of equal persons and societies, its dialogue, co-production of common good by honest
work, integral development economic and intelectual-cultural, equality, social justice and love, peace and
reciprocal settlement. The thirt part of paper speaks about three circles of application of solidarity’s principle;
namely: solidarity professional-working – defend of rihts of workers, solidarity general-social of nation and state
