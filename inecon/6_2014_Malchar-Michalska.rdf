Title: Polski eksport owocow i warzyw. Studium przypadku uznanych organizacji i wstepnie uznanych grup producentow owocow i warzyw (rynek pierwotny) z wojewodztwa dolnoslaskiego / The Polish exports of fruits and vegetables. The case of fruits and vegetables producer organisations and groups (the primary market) from Lower Silesian voivodeship
Abstract: The main goal of the paper was to evaluate changes in Polish fruit and vegetable exports between 2004–2012 and to identify the main export destinations of representatives of the primary market of fruits and vegetables from the Lower Silesian voivodeship. For the purpose of the research, data from the International Trade Centre (ITC) was used. The author also used the method of a case study – fruit and vegetable producer organisations and groups from the Lower Silesian voivodeship were the focus of the research. The analysis allowed the steady growth of fruit and vegetable exports between 2004- 2012 to be identified from Poland as a whole, with the main importing markets being Germany and Russia. The same directions were characteristic among subjects from the Lower Silesian voivodeship.
