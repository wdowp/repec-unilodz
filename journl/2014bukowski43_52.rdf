Title: Pojecie lichwy w ekonomii islamskiej/A Question of Usury in Islamic Economics
Abstract: The concept of Islamic economics as a coherent economic and financial system
basically does not exist. Some authors take it, however, for simplicity, understanding
by this description any entities and legal regulations, mainly in the financial
markets, driven – either declaratively or in fact – on the principles derived from
religious precepts of Islam. The emphasis is put on so-called interest-free banking,
which involves the concept of usury (riba).
By referring to the essence of Islamic economics, the author shows the differences
and similarities between "interest-free" Islamic banking and conventional
banking (Western-style). It turns out that the differences are almost exclusively at
the level of declarations and similarities that arise from attempts to circumvent
religious regulations, as in the riba, are much more numerous than it might seem.
They result from the need to fuse Islamic finances with global financial markets,
which at least at the point of contact eliminates the capability of maintaining the
autonomy of the local banking system. In addition, interest-free Islamic banking
development meets an obstacle in the shape of the market presence of conventional
banks, which are its natural ideological competition. Thus, although the Islamic
Development Bank estimates the size of the market of the Islamic system of financial
services in 2015 at between 2 to 8 trillion dollars, one seems to be entitled
to conclude that, in practice, between Islamic economics and capitalist economies
of the West, at least in terms of banking services, the differences are purely semantic,
and both Western and Islamic deposit, credit and investment products are
in fact identical.
