Title: Uwarunkowania przeplywu polskich bezposrednich inwestycji zagranicznych do krajow Unii Europejskiej. Model grawitacyjny z wykorzystaniem danych panelowych / The determinants of FDI flows from Poland to EU countries. Gravity model using panel data approach
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to test the hypothesis stating that the gravity model of the international trade explains FDI flows from Poland to 27 EU member states.It has been decided to verify how using augumeted gravity model of international trade is allowed to identify push and pull  FDI factors as well as internationalization motives in FDI mode.
The result verified the main hypothesis positively.  Investment decisions concerning the selection of the target country are determined by the size of the market measured by GDP per capita what means market seeking motive is presence. It has been empirically proven that taxation differences and labor costs (efficiency seeking motives) have a significant influence upon decisions on investment FDI in particular host countries.
