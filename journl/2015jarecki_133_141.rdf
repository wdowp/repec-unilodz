Title: Motywacje przy podejmowaniu studiow wyzszych
ekonomicznych/Motivations for Undertaking Economic Studies at University Level
Abstract: Higher education should enable students to raise their qualifications, and particularly
acquire new knowledge, develop their interests, or learn to think critically. As
for economics students, tertiary education should provide them with opportunity to
find and follow their career path. Having this in mind, the author of the present
paper discusses factors contributing to economics students' involvement in raising
their qualifications. The main aim is to state why they have become less involved
in doing so, and particularly in acquiring new knowledge.
