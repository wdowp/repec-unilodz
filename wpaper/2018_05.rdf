Title: Demand and Supply Shock Symmetry across Polish Voievodships
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to evaluate the symmetry of demand and supply shocks affecting
Polish voievodships and to assess the risk of asymmetric shocks in the future. The study
employs the SVAR-based Blanchard and Quah (1989) decomposition as modified by
Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1992) and utilizes a new method of estimating quarterly GDP by
voievodships. The results point to a relatively high symmetry of shocks and a rather low risk
of their occurrence. Shock asymmetry does not appear to be strongly related to differences in
production structures, which is claimed in most theoretical approaches, including the
Optimum Currency Areas Theory.
