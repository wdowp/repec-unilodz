Title: Ponadnarodowe korporacje jako podmioty nieformalnego wplywu na przykladzie zaangazowania w dzialania
skierowane do osób LGBT w Polsce/Transnational Corporations as Entities of Informal Inflence. Some Reflctions Based on the Example of Their
Engagement in Activities Directed to LGBT Groups in Poland
Abstract: The paper explores the assertion about multi-faceted tools of impact used by large
corporations that they aim to limit the subjectivity of consumers. It is based on
the concept of ‘deep capture’ developed by Jon Hanson and David Yosifon. According
to this concept consumers have only the idea of their own subjectivity.
The authors’ basic assumption is that human behaviour is largely (but not completely)
dependent on external situational factors rather than the individual dispositions
of individuals. In this context we analyse the role of large corporations in
shaping the image of LGBT people in Poland. Noteworthy seems to be the consideration
to build and strengthen the belief that LGBT people are a group which
suffers discrimination, to which anyone should make gestures of support throughout
consumer decisions. An overview of the activities of business entities for
LGBT groups in Poland lets us say that they cannot be called large scale actions.
The actions of Polish companies can be recognised as not very intensive. Western
transnational corporations have huge experience in actions for LGBT people, but
this is not necessarily the case in Poland.
