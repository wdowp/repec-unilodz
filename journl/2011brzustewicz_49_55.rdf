shoulders. Therefore, we need the changes that consist in revaluing the previous anthropocentric stance in ethics
into the ethics based on responsibility principle, in which the biosphere might be perceived not only as an object
of man’s industrial activity, but first of all as a subject of his responsibility.
Keywords: responsibility, natural environment, H. Jonas, ethics of responsibility, manager’s ethics
