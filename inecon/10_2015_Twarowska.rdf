Title: Od Mao Zedonga do Xi Jinpinga. Cechy, cele, kierunki i narzędzia zagranicznej polityki gospodarczej Chińskiej Republiki Ludowej / From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping. The foreign economic policy of the PRC – characteristics, objectives, directions and tools
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to evaluate the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign economic policy and to indicate the consequences of that policy for China’s position on the international scene. The paper presents the characteristics, objectives, directions and tools of its foreign policy, with special emphasis on economic aspects. The most important conclusion from the analysis is that in the last 65 years, since the establishment of the PRC, a unique style of Chinese foreign policy was formed, which is based on money, not arms. China has experienced
significant economic and social development, but is still facing opportunities as well as challenges and threats.
