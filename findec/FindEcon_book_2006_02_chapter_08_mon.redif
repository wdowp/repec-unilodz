Title: Forecasting the Conditional Skewness and Kurtosis of the Polish Financial Returns
Abstract: Chapter 8 presents evaluation of conditional density forecasts of financial returns, i.e. exchange rate EUR/PLN, stock index MIDWIG, and 6-month WIBOR. The forecasts are derived from GARCH models in which innovations are allowed to have time-varying or even failing to exist skewness and kurtosis. The main finding is that conditional skewness and kurtosis of returns change over time but their dynamics are different.
