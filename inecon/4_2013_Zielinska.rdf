Title: Droga do unii bankowej - reformy systemu regulacji sektora bankowego / The route to banking union - reforms of the banking sector regulation system
Abstract: The reform of financial supervision is seen as the key step to make the Eurozone and in the broader sense European Union less vulnerable to financial and economic crises. Many economists point, that the ultimate objective of such endeavours should be the establishment of the banking union. The article presents an analysis of that concept. In particular reforms aiming at stabilization of the liquidity of the banking sector have been scrutinized.
