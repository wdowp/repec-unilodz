Title: Transformacja wartosci a postawy przedsiebiorcze Polakow/The Transition of Values and Entrepreneurial Attitudes of the Poles
Abstract: Poland’s transformation occurs in individuals’ attitudes and behaviour. Several years
ago, the entrepreneur in Poland was associated with corruption and borderline legal
activities. Today, many entrepreneurs are looked upon as positive role models. Social
acceptance of entrepreneurial attitudes in Poland is growing. Increased susceptibility
to entrepreneurial behaviour in a society will increase the rate at which new
businesses are established, enhancing market dynamics, and accelerating innovative
changes. But in Poland entrepreneurs are not seen as a positive example, unlike in
the United States. Willingness to take risks, self-expression and independence are
not met with social acceptance, especially if rewarded with high incomes. The research
undertaken by the author is aimed at analysing the essence of entrepreneurial
attitudes and changes in the social acceptance of entrepreneurial behaviour.
