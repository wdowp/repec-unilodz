Title: The Meaning of Concepts of Human Nature in Organizational Life in Business Ethics Context
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to exhibit the role of the concept of human nature
for the ethical orientation of organizational life. Therefore, after presenting some
definitions of the concepts of human nature, which depict the complexity of these
phenomena, some models of the concepts of human nature are described. Furthermore,
the setting of the concepts of human nature in the organizational life is
discussed. Those concepts can be perceived as a deep-structure of the organizational
life, having an impact not only on the individual behaviour of employees
and managers (like sensibility for human emotions, pro-social engagement, communication
style), but also affecting their moral competence and influencing
whole organizational culture – image of the organization, preferred management
strategies and the way of perceiving justice. Those elements play crucial role in
ethical attitude of the organization because all those variables support the efficacy
of ethical rules and most of them are part of ethical code and corporate ethical
code. Therefore, it is necessary for an organization to consider implicit and explicit
concepts of human nature on which the organizational culture is based and support
those concepts, which enables the ethical conduct of the organization and
being alert especially to the consequences of materialistic/egoistic and competitive
concepts of human nature. The theses discussed in the paper are supported by
some empirical research studies conducted in this field.
