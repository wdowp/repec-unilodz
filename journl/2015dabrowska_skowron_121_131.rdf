Title: Porownanie postaw przedsiebiorczych studentow studiow ekonomicznych, spolecznych i humanistycznych/A Comparison of Enterprising Attitudes of Students of Economics, Social Studies and Humanities
Abstract: Success in economic life is a result of the interaction of many factors, which in
different ways are developed from the individual characteristics of the person, a specific
way of thinking and the ability to perceive oneself in the future. At the same
time, more and more attention is focused on the influence of the entrepreneurial
characteristics of individuals on their career development and career building process.
The impact of personal experience on the perception of individual chances on
the labour market is also emphasized. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to
identify the differences in enterprising attitudes of students of the humanities and
students of economics, as well as compare the characteristics of entrepreneurial
abilities between both student groups on the basis of empirical research conducted
among students at the University of Lodz.
