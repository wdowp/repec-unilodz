Title: Kodeks etyczny samorzadu zawodowego. Gwarancja bezpieczenstwa czy pulapka latwowiernosci?/Ethical Code of Professional Association. Security Guarantee or the Credulity Trap?
Abstract: Representatives of business ethics examine the economic challenges of our time.
They believe that in the use of ethics they are able to keep under control this sphere
of human activity. Alas, this attempt meets the following obstacle. This ethical claim
does not work as an objective criterion for measuring good vs evil as long as it is not
supported by epistemological evidence (on its validity). Therefore business ethicists
focus their attention on the codes of ethics which they see as the expected solution
to the problem. A code of ethics is drawn up by an economic organisation which – in
this way – declares its acceptance. Meanwhile, this declaration leads to the question
of how to sift the ethical guarantees from empty promises? Can the social addressee
of an ethical code trust its author? This doubt relates in particular to professional
associations. Having a legal prerogative they are expected to recognize their fiduciary
duty of loyalty to their social interlocutor. When they do not want to meet these
obligations, they may use a code of ethics as a tool of manipulation. Under those
circumstances, the code is something opposite to what is expected.
