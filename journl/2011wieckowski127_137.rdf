Title: Naukowy hedonizm jako podstawa krytycznej oceny przemian spolecznych – ekonomia szczescia Richarda Layarda, Marka Anielskiego i Richarda Easterlinaskiej/Scientific Hedonism as a Basis for the Critical Assessment of the Social Transformations – Richard Layard’s, Mark Anielski’s and Richard Easterlin’s Economy of Happiness 
Abstract: Since about 1970 there is a growing scientific interest in the concept of happiness (or its measurable
equivalent – subjective well-being SWB). It is assumed that if augmenting happiness is assumed as the aim
of social development, it can be assessed if real progress is being made. It should replace traditional concept
of GDP. Researchers like Richard Layard, Mark Anielski and Richard Easterlin use the concept of happiness to
mount a critique of contemporary free-market capitalism. They suggest that instead of consumption and competition,
governments should promote happiness, tightening interpersonal relationship, building social trust, timing
strive for prestige. However other researchers (Ruut Veenhoven, Betsey Sevenson and Justin Wolfers among
others) defend economical growth as a foundation of every social development. The discussion has a philosophical
paradox in it – those how attack capitalism from a humanistic angle use a hedonistic and selfish concept
of subjective happiness while those who defend capitalism appeal to values that goes beyond it.
