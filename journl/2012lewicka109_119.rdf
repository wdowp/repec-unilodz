Title: Etyczny wzor lobbingu: analiza kodeksow regulujacych dzialalnosc lobbingowa/Ethical Pattern of Lobbying: An Analysis of the Lobbying Codes of Ethics
Abstract: Self-regulation initiatives are undertaken by many lobbing circles in various countries. The key element of those initiatives are codes
of ethics including a postulated model of lobbying activities, a specific pattern of ethical standards of lobbying. The aim of the article
is a reconstruction of this pattern on the basis of the analysis of eight codes representing American, Polish, British, European and German
lobbying.
The analysis leads to the following conclusions. An axiological base of the lobbyist profession is created by such values as honesty,
reliability, integrity, trust, professionalism, civil responsibility, openness, transparency, loyalty, respect, courtesy. Norms included
in the codes are concentrated on the following issues: legality, transparency of actions, care of reputation and dignity of profession, avoiding
corruption, conflict o f interest, customer relationship, duties toward society, public relations.
A weak element of lobbying self-regulation is a system of norm execution.
