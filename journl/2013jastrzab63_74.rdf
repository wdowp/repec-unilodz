Title:  Problematyka spolecznej odpowiedzialnosci w nauczaniu historii biznesu w Harvard Business School/Social Responsibility in Business History Teaching at Harvard Business School
Abstract: Based on case studies prepared at the Harvard Business School, the article analyses the content
of university courses on business history. Its aim is to answer the question whether or not business
history courses are used for discussing the problems of CSR or moral dilemmas behind strategic
decisions made by managers.
The article argues that the chance of enhancing the understanding of social problems on the part
of the managers and shaping their responsiveness to them, created by the presence of courses
on history in the academic curriculum, remains, to a large extent, unrealised. Teaching materials
are still influenced by the Chandlerian paradigm and thus focus on changes in organisational structures
and strategies of large multinational companies. They pay little attention to the social environment
of business, rarely pose questions on the motivations of human actions or value hierarchies and avoid
discussions on the social consequences of management decisions.
