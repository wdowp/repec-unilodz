Title: The Ethical Aspect of the Relationship of the Individual and the State in the Libertarian Perspective of Murray N. Rothbard
Abstract: On the grounds of the libertarian ethics presented by Murray N. Rothbard, the
state is an institution which acts against individuals and whole societies. The state
steals money from its citizens (taxes), stands in the way of free market development
and controls the economy, thus hindering entrepreneurship. Besides that, the
state – through its rules and regulations – limits every man's right to make moral
choices. The state is an immoral institution, therefore its citizens have the right to
refuse to pay taxes, follow orders, and even – in some circumstances – corrupt
civil servants. In this paper we analyse Rothbard’s ethics and look into the arguments
of critics of libertarian thought. Practical social and economic solutions that
emerge from Rothbard’s point of view are also considered.
