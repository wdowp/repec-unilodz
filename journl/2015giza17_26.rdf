Title: O wartosciowaniu dobr ekonomicznych/On the Valuation of Economic Goods
Abstract: The presented study includes an analysis of the category of ‘good’ on the basis of
philosophy and economics. Particular attention was paid here to the factors determining
the monetary value (price) of an economic good. While achieving the assumed
objective of the research, answers to the following questions were sought:
What is the difference, therefore, in the interpretation of good as an axiomatic category
and good which the economy deals with? What is the basis for the valuation
of goods which are the subject of economic analysis? While seeking answers to
these questions, an attempt was made to justify the thesis according to which contemporary
understanding of the way of valuating goods by the market is limited to
accepting the price understood as a variable representing a kind of relationship set
in a given time period.
