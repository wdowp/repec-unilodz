Title: Political Corruption and Electoral Systems Seen with Economists’ Lenses
Abstract: The ongoing process of democratisation lead to the growing importance of the
electoral systems that regulate the procedures of gaining and legitimizing power in
democracy. Taking it into account it is worth asking about the relationship between
these particular ‘game rules’ contained into electoral law and the respect of
the rule of law, being one of the basic norms of a democratic system. A question
then may be raised about the existence and the character of the relation between
electoral systems and the level of political corruption. It is worth noticing that
besides the research conducted by political scientists and the representatives of
various branches of social sciences the significant analysis of the issue have been
presented by the economists.
In this article a brief overview of the economic studies on the relationship between
level of political corruption and the electoral systems is presented so as to
assess to what degree this approach may be treated as fruitful.
