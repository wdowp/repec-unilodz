Abstract: The goal of the text is to show which actions of the modern pharmaceutical industry
are morally controversial. There are several burning issues that we need to face on
this field, such as: How to deal with the conflict of interests within the medicine?
How to mark the vanishing boundaries between information and advertisement concerning
the pharmaceutical education? How does the drug advertisement lead to the
pharmaceuticalization of society? In the text all of these problems will be briefly
analysed. The article has an introductory character, it may serve as an overview of
the burning issues in the pharmaceutical industry ethics – all questions that are
posed in the text need further examination.
