Title: Economics in Times of Crisis. In Search of a New Paradigm
Abstract: The relationship between the development of economics and economic performance is not
reducible to any set of simple rules. Among the historians of economic thought there is even a handful
of those who perceive the progress in economics mostly as an outcome of the attempts to solve the
problems, inconsistencies and paradoxes within economic theory itself. Seen from this perspective,
economic reality has minor (or no) importance.
On the other hand, the endeavours to modify a mainstream approach are significantly greater in times
of economic downturns. Seeing that economics is in such a state of ‘intellectual ferment’ nowadays,
it is worth reconsidering the connection between economics and the economy. Thus the main aim
of the paper is to analyse the current state of economic science in relation to the last economic slump.
Although it is of course not possible to predict the future trajectories of economic theorising, taking
into consideration the nature of the crisis the most feasible and potentially most fruitful areas are
indicated.
