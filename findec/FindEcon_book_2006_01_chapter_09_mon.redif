Title: R&D Portfolio Selection Based on Conditional Stochastic Dominance
Abstract: Chapter 9 describes the methodology for the selection of R&D projects into a portfolio. It extends the framework of the conditional stochastic dominance usually employed to analyze stock portfolios. It is concluded that this methodology and its recommendations, if applied properly, are consistent with observed decision-maker behavior.
