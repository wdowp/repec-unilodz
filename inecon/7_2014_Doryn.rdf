Title: Finansowe determinanty deinternacjonalizacji polskich spó³ek akcyjnych w latach 2008-2011 / Financial determinants of de-internationalization of Polish joint-stock companies in 2008-2011
Abstract: The purpose of this article was to outline the area of research on de-internationalization in the context of Polish enterprises. In order to achieve it, an overview of previous studies was made and an attempt at interpreting the de-internationalization on the basis of the Uppsala model and network approach was presented.
The article attempts to identify the most important factors for de-internationalization in the case of Polish companies. The study included the financial statements of companies listed on the main market of the Warsaw Stock Exchange belonging to electric machinery, chemical, pharmaceutical and plastics industries. In the present study, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm has been applied.
The results show that the key factors influencing the de-internationalization of Polish companies were return on sales in the previous year, growth rate of sales, size of the company and change of the operating costs indicator. The results seem to confirm the thesis that the main factor in export competitiveness of Polish enterprises is low production costs.
