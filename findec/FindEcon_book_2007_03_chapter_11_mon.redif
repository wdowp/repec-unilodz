Title: A Generalization of the Stability of Equilibrium in a Repeated Game
Abstract: This chapter concerns some new theoretical aspects of repeated games, which are considered fundamental in dealing with conflict situations. Our objective is to perform a quasi-formalization of the concept of repeated game. The equilibrium is a notion that characterizes all conflict situations. Although it can be easily defined, it is not always easily discernable. The determination of equilibrium and the study of its stability become more complicated when dealing with repeated conflict situations.
