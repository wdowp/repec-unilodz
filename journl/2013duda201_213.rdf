Title:  Milosierdzie i gospodarka – od gor poboznych do wspolnego ratowania sie w nieszczesciu/Charity and the Economy. From Montes Pietatis to the Mutual Aid
Abstract: Charity, the core of the Gospel ethos, became one of the founding ideas of European civilization
and distinguished it from others. In Polish territories, as in other Western European countries, charity
work was conducted primarily by the Church, which together with its sense of Gospel duty, defended
the weak by concerning itself with economic development. For this purpose, charitable credit
institutions, so-called mounts of piety (montes pietatis), were established. They were continued
by reformers, in a somewhat changed form, until the decline of the Polish Commonwealth (Republic).
The most original institution of this kind was Rev. Stanis³aw Staszic’s foundation: the Hrubieszów
Agricultural Society, which survived until the days of the Polish People’s Republic.
