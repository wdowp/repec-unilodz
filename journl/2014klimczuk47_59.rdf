Title: Podejscie umiarkowane w sporze o mozliwosc i uzytecznosc moralna kodyfikacji norm etycznych/Moderate Position in the Debate on the Moral Possibility and Usefulness of Ethical Standards Codification
Abstract: The popularisation of code elaboration addressed to various social groups
is one of the features of the modern world. However, among researchers of this
phenomenon a full consensus on the moral validity and usefulness of this activity
does not exist. The article closely reviews the literature with regard to the reasons
for the creation of a moderate position on the codification of ethical standards.
The essay brings closer the main concepts of ethical codes and positions for their
adoption and rejection. Attention is paid to ways of increasing the effectiveness
of codes and the ethical decision-making procedure in a manner that undermines
supporters and opponents of codification approaches.
