Title: Nauczanie Jana Paw³a II oraz Koscio³a Katolickiego dotyczace zagadnien etycznych zycia rodzinnego i partnerskiego a poglady na ten temat lodzkiej mlodziezy akademickiej/The Teaching of John Paul II and of the Catholic Church Regarding Ethical Matters of the Family Life and the Views of Lodz’s Students
Abstract: Evaluating demographical changes in Poland and Europe at the turn of 20th century, researchers more often
use the expression „family crisis”. The increase in the number of divorces and in the number of extra-marital
births, prevalence of pre-marital cohabitation, as well as its increased acceptance in the society and the increase
in the scope of voluntary childlessness make up such an approach to the situation.
This article presents and discusses the results of a survey concerning ethical matters of family life conducted
in April 2010 amongst students of Lodz’s colleges. The responses were contrasted with the declared
influence of Pope John Paul’s II pontificate. A vast majority of students claim to decide upon religious wedding
while entering into marriage. They also declare bringing up their potential off springs in catholic tradition. The
students of Lodz are also critical of abortion. It needs to be highlighted that in almost all aspects of family life
people, who declared a positive influence of the teaching and life of the Polish Pope on their behaviour, more
often than others supported the teaching of Roman Catholic Church.
On the basis of the conducted survey it may be noticed that the students of Lodz remember about the
Polish Pope and his teaching, however, do not support all of his views as far as family life is concerned. Also the
majority of the students would say they belong to „the generation of JPII”.
