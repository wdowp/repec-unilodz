Title: Merytokracja czy „elity odpowiedzialnosciowe”? Ewangelicka interpretacja zagadnienia elit spolecznych/Meritocracy or the ‘Responsibility Elite’: an Evangelical
Approach to the Issue of Social Elites
Abstract: The notion of meritocracy is among the keywords used in order to describe the
contemporary world. It has become more and more an inherent concept of an
order whose main factors are said to be globalization as well as the impact of free
market philosophy on society and culture. The concept of meritocracy considers
the nature of elites. On the one hand, meritocratic elites are taken from groups
selected for their merits and competences, but on the other hand they avoid their
responsibility towards society and culture. Amongst many counterproposals it
seems worthwhile to present the evangelical concept of elites which is deeply
embedded in evangelical social teaching. Evangelical theology introduces in its
social discourse the notion of the responsibility elites. According to evangelical
theologians, the key task to overcome the growing social, economic and cultural
crisis of today may be found in the rehabilitation of the notion of common good.
Interpreted from a sociological as well as theological standpoint, responsibility
elites play an important role when spreading the concept of the common good.
The article presents theological guidelines of evangelical teaching on elites as well
as evangelical proposals concerning the issue collating them with the broad diagnosis
of the meritocratic elites.
