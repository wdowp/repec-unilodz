Title: The impact of the euro adoption on the complexity of goods in Slovenian exports
Abstract: In this paper, we estimate Erceg, Henderson and Levin’s [2000] sticky price and sticky wage dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model while allowing for wage or price Calvo parameters regime switching and compare this with the constant parameters model. Our results suggest that the model with price and wage rigidity switching is strongly favored by the data. However, we do not find significant evidence in support of independent Markov chains. Moreover, we identify historical periods
when price and wage stickiness were low and show that during such periods, the economy reacts more strongly to structural shocks.
