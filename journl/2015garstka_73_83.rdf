Title: Problematyka etyczna w pierwszych dzielach o rachunkowosci/Ethics in the Early Works of Accounting
Abstract: Accountants recently had the opportunity to celebrate 20 years of existence in Poland
the regulating of accounting. The act was adopted by parliament in 1994. 500
years before the treaty about double accounting was reprinted by Pacioli. The edition
of Tractatus XI. Particularis de computis et scripturis was an (epic) epoch-making
event designating the beginning of a new field of economic sciences. The idea
of the double accounting was known before, not only because of Pacioli, but also
through Cotruglio, who described it 36 years earlier.
Recently in accounting, as well as in the broadly understood economy, there
is a particular emphasis put on ethics, moral values and professional attitudes. It is
worth considering whether and on what scale they were present in the early works
of Accountancy 550 years ago, how their representatives approached the subjects
the beginning of a written history of accounting.
The article presents the main ideas included in the guidelines Pacioli and Cotruglio
regarding double accounting, and identifies if ethical guidelines were presents
among others guidelines. It turns out that the author of the essential work in
the history of accounting, as well as its predecessor, devoted much attention to the
moral attitude of the merchant, his appropriate behavior, attitude towards customers
and other people, with whom he has a business relationship.
