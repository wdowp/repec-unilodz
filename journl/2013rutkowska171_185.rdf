Title:  Ekonomiczny, spoleczny i egzystencjalny wymiar funkcjonowania placowek hospicyjnych i wolontariatu hospicyjnego/Economic, Social and Existential Dimension of the Functioning of Hospice Institutions and Hospice Voluntary Services
Abstract: The functioning of hospice institutions may be considered based on three fundamental, functions
accomplished by it, i.e. existential, social and economic ones. Holistic evaluation of hospice care
requires taking into account actual and potential advantages, possible to achieve both through society
represented by all citizens, and through the economy.
The article has a survey character – the literature is based on critical analysis within the scope
of the subject raised. The work was made rich from two-year own experience of volunteer work.
For the purpose of realization of the subject raised, empirical examinations were also conducted based
on the method of shadow prices and logical matrix.
In this paper, the implementation of the function of an existential volunteer hospice is considered
on the basis of its ability to alleviate the suffering of patients’ mental and spiritual capacity and give
them practical help by volunteers. The usefulness of hospices, which is a part of their social function,
was studied by considering the point of existence and functioning of palliative and long-term care
centres. In order to define the economic function of a voluntary service, micro and macroeconomic
types of analysis were used. One should, however, emphasise that these examinations should have
an interdisciplinary character.
