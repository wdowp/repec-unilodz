Title: Kulturowo-religijny stosunek do bankowosci a wielkie religie swiata/Cultural and Religious Attitudes to Banking versus
the Great World Religions
Abstract: The article is dedicated to the attitude of the great world religions (Judaism, Christianity,
Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism) to the world of finance, including
banking. The issue of usury plays a key role together with the evolution of
ethical aspects related to obtaining compensation for money lending. The analysis
is focused on the other aspects of banking activities, such as saving, investing, and
institutional development of the banking sector as well. The author underlines the
far-reaching convergence between religions in this area, in spite of the considerable
variation in historical and geographical conditions of their formation. The importance
of cultural (religious) differences, including the nuances or more fundamental
aspects, has a significant impact on bank management in different regions.
For successful development, large multinational corporations have to take into consideration
the abovementioned circumstances, regardless of globalization processes.
