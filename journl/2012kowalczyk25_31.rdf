Title: Etos aktywnosci ekonomicznej w swietle encykliki 'Caritas in Veritate' Benedykta XVI/Ethos of the Economic Activity in the Light of Encyclical 'Caritas in Veritate’ of Pope Benedict XVI
Abstract: Liberalism and marxism are two forms of economism, which separate economic activity from ethics. The social teaching of the Church
accepted continued by pope Benedict XVI recognizes the necessity of free market and limited intervention of the state in economy,
but first of all postulates creativity of civil society in the field of economic life. The main arguments for observance of moral rules
in the economic activity are following: 1. Every conscious and free men’s action is responsible for the effects – economic activity cannot be
any exception; 2. The same ethics ought to be applied in the individual-private life and in the public domain – also economy; 3. Ethos
of economic activity is connected with three virtues – truth, love and justice (also social justice); 4. Christian-personalistic ethics is based
on the principles auxialiarity (personalism) and common good (solidarity). Economic activity completely separated from ethics is inhuman.
