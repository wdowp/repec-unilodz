Title: Firm-size distribution in Poland – is power law applicable?
Abstract: The article focuses on power laws and their growing popularity in science in general and in
economics specifically. The theoretical mechanisms responsible for their generating are reviewed.
We also empirically test whether firm-size distribution of companies in Poland has the characteristics
of the Zipf’s law – a special case of a power law. This is confirmed based on an investigation within
the sample of 2000 largest companies and a set of alternative estimators of the power law exponent.
