Title: Kim jest postmodernistyczny homo oeconomicus, czyli pytanie o wspolczesne relacje pomiedzy rodzina a rynkiem/What Kind of Man is Postmodern Homo Economicus? – Question in Context of Contemporary Relations between Family and Market 
Abstract: This article undertakes the question of „economic man” in context of postmodern philosophy. The purpose
of it is to analyze current understanding of man in market surrounding and his family relations.
In the beginning the genesis of homo economicus model is presented and attempt is made to find answer to
the question of its contemporary meaning and “family situation”. Then the article shows why we should resign
from using this model and substitute it with homo socioeconomicus.
The very concept of homo economicus – well known and often discussed – although reduces human being,
in the light of postmodern thinking seems to relive. That is why it is necessary to reflect if there is similarity
between “economic man” and the vision of man preferred by postmodernism. One of the proofs for it may be
current situation of family which is not supported by postmodern homo economicus concept. It seems to be
logical consequence when we realize that individualism of “economic man” is strengthened by postmodern
antipathy towards social institutions.
