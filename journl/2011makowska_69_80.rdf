Title: Etyczne wyzwania wspolpracy pomiedzy lekarzami a przemyslem farmaceutycznym/Ethical Challenges in the Cooperation between Physicians and Pharmaceutical Industry
Abstract: Over the recent years more and more often we can hear in public debate that pharmaceutical industry is
using aggressive marketing to increase the market growth. Their marketing actions are addressed mainly to
physicians, because doctors are those who raise gains of pharmaceutical companies in the most considerable
extent.
The main aim of this paper is to answer the question what kinds of methods pharmaceutical companies are
using to influence physicians’ prescribing practice. On examples will be shown how pharmaceutical sales representatives
are using reciprocity rule, liking, contrast, authority, scarcity, social proof and consistence to manipulate
on doctors.
The paper will try to answer the questions: Are physicians aware of influence of pharmaceutical companies?
What should be done to increase their awareness?
The article is based on the CAWI research. It is analysis of 372 questionnaires filled by physicians.
Research was conducted with the support of Medycyna Praktyczna site – one of the most famous websites
among the doctors in Poland.
