Title: Etyka galenosfery/The Ethics of Galenosphere 
Abstract: Galenosphere is an environment of silence. The paper addresses the issue of the essence and significance
of galenosphere. To this end, it presents the structure and functioning of galenosphere, i.e. its two crucial components.
Moreover, the structure of galenosphere includes static and dynamic elements. The latter determine the
functioning of this type of environment. Eight most important sectors that affect the operation of galenosphere
were identified. Some of them (the culture of language, noise elimination, creating an environment promoting
silence and a prayer for silence) contribute to the emergence of a structured environment of silence, whereas
others (positive attitude towards calming down, concentration of the mind and emotions, inner concentration and the ability to be silent) constitute components which directly participate in the formation of an environment of
silence. A structured environment of silence is the most effective in operation.
The paper points out various advantages offered to the human being by a structured galenosphere. The
most significant ones include: successful self-improvement, improvement of spoken and written language skills,
effective pedagogic activities, establishing good relationships with other people and getting a deeper insight into
the sense of life. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the human being should be provided with optimal
working conditions and conditions for development in various areas by the formation of a structured
galenosphere (in the family, at school, in the office, etc.).
