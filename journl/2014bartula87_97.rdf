Title: Rownosc versus sprawiedliwosc/Equity versus Justice
Abstract: On the example of a workload dispute (a version of a ‘border dispute’)
I present the general problem of two persons – M and P – with equal entitlements
to one commodity, which is equally desired by both of them. They are both moderately
altruistic; they are not angels untempted by a selfish willingness to get
their own way, nor are they devils, who want to destroy others even if it leads to
self-destruction. As human beings operating in a world of limited goods, they are
so physically and intellectually feeble that neither of them is able to permanently
enslave the other and submit him to the second person’s will.
Such being the case, each solution to the problem means that the profit of one
person is the loss of the second. The question, whether justice is possible at all,
suggests itself whether in a situation when people are more or less equal, or with
limited altruism and/or selfishness and scarce resources.
