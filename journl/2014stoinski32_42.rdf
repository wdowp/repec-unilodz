Title: Wyzysk w perspektywie sprawiedliwosci/Exploitation in the Face of Justice
Abstract: The paper refers to selected problems of exploitation in the face of justice.
The analysis is based on the definitions of exploitation contained in the Polish
Penal and Civil Codes. The main subject of our interest is the identification
of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the recognition of exploitation
as being unjust. Supplementary question will refer to a specific type of justice
which should be considered in this case. In respect to this we should consider
retributive, distributive and social justice. Another important factor in this regard
is the accepted theory of value. In the considered subject we will focus on
the labour theory of value. The principal problem could be reduced to questions
whether the exploitation is ipso facto unjust and how these two phenomena are
related to each other.
