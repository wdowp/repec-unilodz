Title: Etyczne i ekonomiczne uwarunkowania wielkosci produkcji spolecznej w ujeciu Stanislawa Glabinskiego/Ethical and Economic Conditions of Social Production According to Stanislaw Glabinski
Approach to the Issue of Social Elites
Abstract: Stanis³aw G³¹biñski (1862–1941), economist and politician, and one of the main
representatives of the historical trend, sought to develop the national school in the
Polish economy. The nation and national idea were to become its starting point.
By ‘people’ he meant the population in the political sense, i.e. the whole of society
within the state, including the factions and national minorities.
The subject of national economics is the national or social economy. It is the
total unit of a higher order, including all the households in the country linked by
ties of mutual dependence, both material and spiritual. Its purpose and subject is
the society, the nation. Therefore, national economics is a social science. Production
is characterized by a social dimension, its size determined by both economic
and non-economic factors as well as moral and ethical ones. These two aspects are
characteristic of the two categories associated with it, i.e. the social resources and
factors of production.
The category of social resources is similar to Frederick List’s concept of
productive forces, meaning the production capacity of the nation, the power of
producing wealth. G³¹biñski divides them into moral and material resources, attaching
more importance to the moral resources. They are the fullest expression of
the nation’s culture condition, the nation’s moral level and they also provide stable
social bonds.
The concept of moral resources involves two production factors: entrepreneurship
as well as knowledge and work. The material resources represent the
earth (nature) and capital.
