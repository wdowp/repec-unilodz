Title: Improved asymptotic analysis of Gaussian QML estimators in spatial models
Abstract: This paper presents a fundamentally improved statement on asymptotic behaviour of the well-known Gaussian QML estimator of parameters in high-order mixed regressive/autoregressive spatial model. We generalize the approach previously known in the econometric literature by considerably weakening assumptions on the spatial weight matrix, distribution of the residuals and the parameter space for the spatial autoregressive parameter. As an example application of our new asymptotic analysis we also give a statement on the large sample behaviour of a general fixed effects design.
