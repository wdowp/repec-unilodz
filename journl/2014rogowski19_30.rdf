Title: Moralnosc a rynek. Propozycja nowej definicji rynku/Morality and the Market. A Proposal of New Definition of the Market
Abstract: The article presents an analysis of the relationship between market as a social
and economic sphere and morality as a fundamental aspect of human deeds. It discusses
the nature of the market, with a special focus on a person as a main precondition
for the existence of the market. The result of the analysis is a proposal for a new
definition of the market: the market consists in the decisions and actions of persons
concerning what product to buy or sell, at what price, where and when.
