Title: Foreign Policy as Part of Strengthening the Polish Economy in the World: the Ethical Aspect
Abstract: The technological, economic and political advances of the 20th and 21st centuries
have established new conditions for the development of civilization. The world
economy has simultaneously expanded (the number of states/organization participating
in world trade or the volume of heterogeneous transactions) and shrunk
(close interrelations between transactions, no matter their geographic origins).
Economic policy has gained an indispensable role in the creation of order in international
relations and foreign policy. The tendency to prioritize foreign policy
aims towards economic policy aims has resulted in ‘reverse flow’, i.e. foreign
policy has become a central part of national economic policy.
The engagement of external action services and public budget in economic
promotion and investments triggers (inter alia) the ethics dilemma. The mentioned
ethical aspect is often omitted when discussing ‘the economic foreign policy’. For
instance, the ethics dilemma can appear when development and humanitarian aid
are taken into account or when it comes to assessing the results (and membership)
of economic missions. In this context, the author analyses the Polish foreign policy
example and attempts to answer two questions. First, are the economic activities
performed by external action services effective? Second, are the mentioned
activities in accordance with the social ethical code of conduct? The author focuses
on three elements – development and humanitarian aid, the participation of
Polish diplomats in economic promotion, and economic missions.
