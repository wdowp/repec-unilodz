Title: Aspekty etyczne badan naukowych w polskim pielegniarstwie/Ethical Aspects of Polish Scientific Research in Nursing
Abstract: Recent years in Poland have been characterized by the dynamic development of
scientific activity among nurses. It might have been caused by several factors,
namely: the rising needs and expectations of representatives of this professional
group, the necessity of adjusting to EU standards, changes in the system of education,
as well as the individual “research needs” of those representatives. However,
is there a correlation between the increase in the quantity of scientific research and
its quality? An attempt to answer that question led the author to formulate this paper’s
goal, which had been formulated as follows: to analyse different sources of
information concerning the reality of scientific research in nursing in Poland.
