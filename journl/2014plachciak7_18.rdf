Title: Tony’ego Blaira koncepcja socjalizmu etycznego/Tony Blair’s Ethical Socialism Concept
Abstract: One of the main concerns of Tony Blair’s policy and his New Labour Party
agenda was focused on the values which always played a fundamental role within
the British labour tradition. According to Blair, the policy is a matter of values,
among which he points to social justice, international solidarity, democracy and
freedom. All of them have always sketched the moral stricture of the traditional
program of social democracy. The list of those values he completes with the following
new ones: a civil society, equal value of all people, equal chances, patriotism
and well-being. Blair’s political project, called the third way, was planned to
bring about the country’s modernization in the face of rapid global changes. The
basic purpose of the article is to present the place of the value system within
the program of the British New Labour Party. New Labour axiology was supposed
to play a fundamental role not only within the concept of society, but also infiltrate
all spheres of political and economical life.
