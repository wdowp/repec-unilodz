Title: Ekonomia narodowa a etyka w ujeciu Stanislawa Glabinskiego/National Economics and Ethics according to Stanislaw Glabinski
Abstract: Stanislaw Glabinski (1862-1941), professor of Lviv University and the author
of the two-volume ‘National Economics (‘Ekonomika narodowa’), was one
of the main representatives of the historical-national approach in Polish economics.
The study of national economics which he created was divided into general
economics, i.e. economic theory, and practical economics, referred to as economic
and social policies. Glabinski emphasizes that there is a close relationship between
the latter and ethics. Before the development of economic theory, economic
thought was normative, because of its close relationship to ethics. However, it was
not the history of economic theory, but the history of the notion of economic
politics and of its practical application. Due to the social nature of ethics, there
are also specific relations between it and theoretical economics. In modern countries
finding a solution to the so-called social question has become a common task
of economics and ethics.
Ethical topics are also contained in the content of the category ‘social resources’,
in which the social determinants of human economic activity find their
fullest reflection. This applies in particular to the category of moral resources,
which illustrates the functioning of state bodies and public institutions, the state
of education, the prevailing habits and the customs and the character of the nation.
