Title: Gospodarki Danii, Finlandii i Szwecji a globalny kryzys finansowy / The Global Financial Crisis in Denmark, Finland and Sweden
Abstract: This paper explores the Nordic states (Denmark, Finland and Sweden) during the global crisis in the period 2007−2012. The Nordic states have a high rate of socio-economic growth and competitive advantage but Denmark, Finland and Sweden still experienced the global crisis.
However, the global financial crisis followed different paths in these countries. As a result, the economic effects of the crisis in Denmark, Sweden and Finland were better, compared to other advanced economies of European Union.
The aim of this paper is to present a comparative study of the reaction of the Nordic states to the financial crisis and the economic crisis.
