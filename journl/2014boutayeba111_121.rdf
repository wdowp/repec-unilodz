Title: Ethics in Islamic Economics
Abstract: The purpose of this contribution is to shed some light on the inter-relationships
between ethics and economics in Islamic religion, and mainly to assert that ethics
constitute endogenous phenomena in Islamic economics. In Islam, economic behaviours
and transactions cannot be separated from ethics and values. The Islamic
principles are intended to govern, direct and control human beings’ behaviours in
their daily economic lives. They are aimed at helping people to distinguish between
good and bad things while they do any economic activity.
It is worth noting that the moral values in Islamic economics are derived
from the main sources of Islam namely: the Quran (the holy book of Islamic religion)
and Sunnah (the teachings and behaviours of the prophet of Islam: Muhammad
PBUH 570-632 AD). Both of them represent the principal pillars of Shariah
(Islamic laws and guidelines), which is seen by Muslims as the proper way to
happiness, not only in economic life but in all aspects of life.
