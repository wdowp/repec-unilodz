Title: Przedmiot lobbingu z perspektywy etycznej/Lobbying from an Ethical Perspective
Abstract: The aim of the article is a review of the wide spectrum of lobbying formulations and definitions 
to answer questions regarding the areas of lobbying activity. The author argues that lobbying is a wide 
scope of activities that lobbyists undertake according to their expectations and preferences. Ethical 
reflections on lobbying activity should then take into consideration the conditions in which the main 
players on the democratic political scene interact with each other.
