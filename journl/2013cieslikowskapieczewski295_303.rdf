Title: Normy etyczne obowiazujace pracodawcow. Perspektywa systemu prawnego, organizacji i pracownika/Ethical Standards Binding on Employers. Perspectives of the Legal System, Organizations and Employees
Abstract: The aim of this article is to point out the basic areas of judgment made by employees
considering the ethical or unethical behaviour of employers in the workplace. The authors analyse this
subject from three perspectives: The first one is labour legislation in Poland; the second
is the perspective of employers, especially codes of ethical standards created by contemporary
organizations, and the third perspective is the point of view of employees. The conclusions in this area
have been made on the basis of research in two Polish insurance companies. The authors attempted
to create a ranking of ethical elements significant for employees. Such knowledge could be very useful
for creating proper personnel policy in any organisation.
