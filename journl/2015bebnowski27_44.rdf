Title: Atrakcyjnosc projektu metodologii praktycznej i epistemologii cnoty dla badan historyczno-gospodarczych/The Attractiveness of the Project of Practical Methodology and Virtue Epistemology for Economic History Research
Abstract: Ewa Domañska, Professor at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznañ (Poland)
and Stanford University (USA), historian of historiography and methodologist of
history, formulated interesting comments about the state of humanities and social
sciences. The development of interdisciplinary research causes the interpenetration
of different disciplines. Although this kind of research is promising, inspiring as
well as influencing the development of science, careless research may cause some
threats in the longer term. According to Domañska, the lack of qualifications and
reliability in this area (especially in the area of theory and methodology) undermines
the authonomy of the main disciplines and decline in the professionalism of research.
This led the author to create the project, which aims to defend the independence
of the threatened disciplines as well as their ‘re-professionalisation’. It can be
achieved by strongly emphasizing the role of theory in science; a strong embeddement
of a discipline in the theory. Domañska’s concept can be a recipe, which is
a dichotomic project. Firstly, it supposes a ‘practical methodology’, which is a constructing
of the theory thanks to empirical research material. Secondly, it supposes
a ‘virtue epistemology’, which is the ethical aspect of the researcher’s attitude and
his work.
The aim of the paper is to discuss Domañska’s project and underline the originality
of her concept in the context of economic and social sciences. The economic
history is a specific discipline which develops at the crossroad of history and economics.
It lets me put forward the thesis that Domañska’s suggestions are relevant
to the research of economic history. I will show what cognitive chances are the
result of the ontology of economic history. I will question what the possible threats
are for the main disciplines (history and economics) as a result of the lack of professionalism
in the interdisciplinary research of the economic past, and ask if Domañska’s
project is attractive for the economic history research thanks to the strong
setting in the ‘practical methodology’ in the theory. I also ask what the role of new
theoretical approaches in that area is, and whether it is possible to formulate innovatory
conceptions in the economic history. Finally, I question the role of ‘virtue
epistemology’ or the ethical aspect of an economic historian’s work.
