Title: Statystyka a etyka/Statistics and Ethics
Approach to the Issue of Social Elites
Abstract: The article concerns ethical rules complied with both by public statistics and users
of public statistics. Ethical rules in statistics are partly codified in the European Statistics
Code of Practice published by Eurostat, the statistical bureau of the European
Union. Implementation of this code is subject to periodical reviews. The second
part of the paper deals with various manipulations of statistical data performed by
its users. The thesis of the paper states that if non-ethical practices appear, either in
public statistics or in manipulations by users, they are relatively quickly denounced.
This thesis is supported by some empirical facts.
