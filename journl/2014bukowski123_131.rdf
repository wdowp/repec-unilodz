Title: Social Role of Alms (zakat) in Islamic Economies
Abstract: Islam as both religion and socioeconomic system is based on five main pillars, that
is – five basic acts considered mandatory by Muslims, summarized in the hadith of
Gabriel. One of them is zakat (almsgiving), i.e. giving 2.5% of one’s wealth to the
poor and needy.
In contrary to Christian religion, where question of charity is rather of a voluntary
matter, the role of zakat in Islam is much more rigidly described. Almsgiving
is considered as a duty of a pious Muslim towards the poor. Thus in Islamic
economy, strongly based on Islam principles given by Allah to Muhammad, zakat
is imposed by law and is not considered a charity but duty rather. The notion of
zakat is mentioned in Qur-an over a 100 times, solely or in conjunction with other
commandments. On a basis that zakat is to be paid as a part of total wealth exceeding
given minimum wealth (nisab) it is then justifiable to say that zakat is
principally a tax.
A role of this essay is to shed some light on a utilisation and role of zakat in
Islamic economies in socioeconomic context, with an example of Islamic Republic
of Pakistan, where in 1980 the Zakat Ordinance was imposed. The concept of
zakat is present in many Islamic countries, but its nature varies, being dependent
from the interpretation of religious law in a given country. Everywhere though, its
social role as an important tool maintaining social justice is strongly expressed.
Of course zakat system also has its drawbacks and is subjected to much criticism.
The article aims to present both advantages and negative aspects of zakat.
