Title: Coz po pedagogice w ponowoczesnosci?/Why We Need Pedagogy in Post-Modernism?
Abstract: This article depicts five approaches to pedagogy, which can be recognized in the course of history: 1) Pedagogy as a philosophy
(science of man, paideia, educational anthropology), 2) pedagogy as an independent discipline of humanities, 3) pedagogy as a subject of
academic and vocational studies, 4) pedagogy as a subjective theory of education and 5) pedagogy as a community intellectual formation. I
am still looking for answers to the question, which of these approaches raises criticism or points to the evolution of educational sciences and
schooling as a helpful reflection for practitioners and new directions in researches. 
Keywords: pedagogy, educational science, meta-theory of education, colloquial theories of education, intellectual formation,
philosophy of education
