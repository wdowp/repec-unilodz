Title: Forecasting the Returns Based on the Panel Data Estimation Methods
Abstract: The purpose of the chapter is to show if there is a relationship between the rates of return from portfolios applying SUR and CSCTA models. If the results confirm the rationality of applying panel data models then forecasts of returns will be calculated. The chapter also aims to test whether the forecasts obtained from the above models are more accurate than those obtained from OLS estimation method.
